-   machine learning types:

    -   supervised learning
    -   unsupervised machine learning
    -   reinforcement learning

-   supervised learning:

    -   by supervising the work of the machine how it treats giving data
    -   and we fix the scaling
    -   we specify type of data before giving it to the machine
    -   supervised learning has 2 types:
        -   regression:
            -   take data from the past and try to predict the future
        -   classification:
            -   sperate data by types (calassify)

-   unsupervised learning:

    -   clustering:
        -   grouping of input variables with similar characteristics
    -   assiociation:
        -   mapping based on data (recomend what user might like)

-   reiforcement learning:

    -   trained base on the feedback from learning
    -   dog example, getting rewards after right choice
    -   machine will learn based on its feedback

-   how machine learning model learn:

    -   model is machine that has been trained
    -   how to train a machine:
        -   training data:
            -   used to teach the algorithm
        -   testing data:
            -   used to verify the learning capability
    -   understand the business problem
    -   data acuisition
    -   data cleaning
    -   explortory data analysis
    -   machine learning algorithm
    -   predict your model accurary
    -   check of it's working or not
    -   deploy the model

-   Linear regression Algorithm:
    Linear regression
    logistic regression
    naive bayes
    k-nn algorithm
    support vector machines (svm)
    random forests

1- linear regression:
    + model target values based on independent variables
    + used for finding out cause-effect relationship between variables

2- Naive Bayes Algorithm:
    + supervised learning
    + used for:
        + used for speack recognition
        + text classification

3- KNN Algorithm: K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm
    - chekc neighbours

4- Support vector machines:
    - more time to train

5- Random forest Algorithm:
    -
